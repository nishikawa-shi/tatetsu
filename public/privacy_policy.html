        <h2>Obtaining and utilizing personal information</h2>
        <p>
            The Tatetsu will obtain personal information through appropriate means. When personal information is obtained directly from a customer, it will be obtained, in principle, after clearly stating the purpose for which that information will be used. The Tatetsu will also never handle personal information beyond the limits of the clearly stated purposes for which the information was obtained.
        </p>
        <h2>Protection and management of personal information (personal data)</h2>
        <p>
            Regarding the personal information obtained, the Tatetsu will make efforts to secure the accuracy of the contents of the data, within the necessary limits for achieving the purposes for which the information is to be used, and will handle the data appropriately to prevent illegal access to the information in question as well as to prevent the loss, destruction, falsification and leaking of the information in question. To accomplish this, the personal information database will be protected and managed in a stringent manner. Except in cases based on the law, The Tatetsu will not provide or disclose to a third party the personal information of a customer without the consent of that individual.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose of use</h2>
        <p>
            The personal information obtained by The Tatetsu will be used in conjunction with the business operations of The Tatetsu in line with (1) the delivery and provision of products and services; (2) announcements about products and services; and (3) studies for the purpose of improving existing products and services or developing new products and services.
        </p>
        <h2>Notification, disclosure and correction of the purpose of use</h2>
        <p>
